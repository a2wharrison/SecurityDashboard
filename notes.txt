ALAS json:
Is the severity different than what amazon has? Why? 
Is that something you are determining in a script and it is sent over to us?

if we are going to have metadata for the module type, we need:

title
base link
description (maybe)

we are going to parse modules by name into the id associated, that way the rest api endpoint does not say the actual name

high severity = 1. medium=2. low = 3

how are we going to page refresh only the updated content?

mark as read
comment field

template the page so they can change features

web sockets, long polling, socetIO
